## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/express-buildkit.git
   cd express-buildkit
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Link Local Dependencies** (if working with zaions-tool-kit)
   ```bash
   yarn run update:linked-packages
   ```

4. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

### Development Commands

- `yarn dev` - Start development with watch mode
- `yarn build` - Build the package
- `yarn test` - Run tests
- `yarn run serve` - Build once with linked packages

### Code Style

We use TypeScript and follow these conventions:

1. **Use TypeScript** - All new code should be written in TypeScript
2. **Type Safety** - Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary
3. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Interfaces: PascalCase with `I` prefix (e.g., `IApiResponse`)
   - Functions: camelCase (e.g., `sendApiResponse`)
   - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
   - Files: camelCase for `.ts` files

4. **File Organization**:
   ```
   src/
   â”œâ”€â”€ configure/     # Configuration functions
   â”œâ”€â”€ middlewares/   # Express middleware functions
   â”œâ”€â”€ types/         # TypeScript type definitions
   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/         # Utility functions
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ helpers/   # Helper functions by category
   â””â”€â”€ validationSchema/ # Zod validation schemas
   ```

5. **Imports**: Use path aliases (`@helpers`, `@enums`, `@zTypes`, `@src`)

### Testing

1. **Write Tests**: All new features should have corresponding tests
2. **Test Files**: Place test files next to the code they test with `.test.ts` extension
3. **Run Tests**: Use `yarn test` to run all tests
4. **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage for new code

Example test:
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { sendApiSuccessResponse } from './apiHelpers';

describe('sendApiSuccessResponse', () => {
  it('should send a 200 response with success true', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Documentation

1. **API Documentation**: Update `DOCUMENTATION.md` for any API changes
2. **README**: Update examples if adding new features
3. **JSDoc Comments**: Add JSDoc comments to exported functions
4. **Type Definitions**: Ensure all exports have proper TypeScript types

### Commit Messages

We follow conventional commit messages:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add custom error handler middleware
fix: correct CORS origin validation
docs: update API documentation for new functions
```

### Release Process

1. **Version Bump**: Update version in `package.json`
2. **Update CHANGELOG**: Document changes in `CHANGELOG.md`
3. **Build**: Run `yarn build`
4. **Test**: Ensure all tests pass
5. **Tag**: Create a git tag for the version
6. **Publish**: Use `yarn deploy` (maintainers only)
